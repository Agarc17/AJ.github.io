* Optimizely - A/B Testing
* Google Analytics - Analytics
* GitHub Pages - Website
* Typeform - Sign Up Form

######Let's Get Started

##Step 1 - Understand Targeted Users
We will be targeting users who enjoy sneakers. Therefore it would be smart to think about where our user base can be found and what they do/possible pain points.
For this we will assume the user base is mainly on Instagram and we will look through and find a couple use cases that may attract users. 

######Note: We also want to pay attention to the type of user we are appealing to.

1. Let's visit [Websta.me](https://websta.me)

2. Type in some hashtags 

3. Point out use cases

* [ ] use case 1
* [ ] use case 2
* [ ] use case 3

We now understand the type of user we are appealing to. Our goal is to get them to sign up for the beta version but to do that we need the following: 

* Set Up Website
* Create Sign Up Form
* A message to say

##Step 2 - Set Up Website
We will use Github Pages to set up the website. (optional)
If you have a Website that you can change feel free to use that instead and skip to step 3
Otherwise continue. 

1. Clone this respository on your computer 
2. Follow these directions to set up your [Github page](https://pages.github.com/)
3. Copy the files from this respository and put them into your Github Pages Respository.

We now have a website up and running.
