######Let's Get Started

##Step 1 - Understand Targeted Users
We will be targeting users who enjoy sneakers. Therefore it would be smart to think about where our user base can be found and what they do/possible pain points.
For this we will assume the user base is mainly on Instagram and we will look through and find a couple use cases that may attract users. 

######Note: We also want to pay attention to the type of user we are appealing to.

1. Let's visit [Websta.me](https://websta.me)

2. Type in some hashtags 

3. Point out use cases

* [ ] use case 1
* [ ] use case 2
* [ ] use case 3

##Step 2 - Set Up Page
We now understand the type of user we are appealing to. Our goal is to get them to sign up for the beta version but to do that we need the following:
